\usage{
extractDocumentation(path, start_type = NULL, comment = "*'")
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{path to the file(s) which should be evaluated}

\item{start_type}{set type for first line of code. This can be useful
to extract documentation even if no documentation type has been set (e.g
reading equations.gms as type realization)}

\item{comment}{comment chars used for documentation comments}
}
\value{
a list of documentation pieces with type as name of each element
}
\description{
Extracts doxygen-like GAMS documentation. Entries are introduced with an @type at the beginning
of the line. In case of @realization also GAMS code is read and interpreted, in all other cases
only the specific documentation comment is evaluated.
}
\examples{
mainfile <- paste0(system.file("dummymodel",package="gms"),"/main.gms")
calcfile <- paste0(system.file("dummymodel",package="gms"),
                           "/modules/02_crazymodule/complex/calculations.gms")
# extracting information from the main file of the model                            
extractDocumentation(mainfile)
# extracting information from a file with some equations in it
extractDocumentation(calcfile)
