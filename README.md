[![Travis build status](https://travis-ci.com/pik-piam/goxygen.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/pik-piam/goxygen) [![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.1411404.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.1411404) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/goxygen/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/pik-piam/goxygen)

## Purpose and Functionality

A collection of tools which extract a model documentation from GAMS code and comments. In order to use the package you need to install pandoc and pandoc-citeproc first (https://pandoc.org/).


## Installation

For installation of the most recent package version an additional repository has to be added in R:

```r
options(repos = c(CRAN = "@CRAN@", pik = "https://rse.pik-potsdam.de/r/packages"))
```
The additional repository can be made available permanently by adding the line above to a file called `.Rprofile` stored in the home folder of your system (`Sys.glob("~")` in R returns the home directory).

After that the most recent version of the package can be installed using `install.packages`:

```r 
install.packages("goxygen")
```

Package updates can be installed using `update.packages` (make sure that the additional repository has been added before running that command):

```r 
update.packages()
```

## Tutorial

The package comes with a vignette describing the basic functionality of the package and how to use it. You can load it with the following command (the package needs to be installed):

```r
vignette(goxygen) # Writing in-source documentation for GAMS code with goxygen
```
